### **3. Data Cleaning**

Data cleaning was performed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the analysis. The key steps in the data cleaning process included:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing or incomplete data points were either filled using imputation techniques or removed where the data was insufficient to influence the overall trends.
- **Normalization:** The data was normalized to account for different time periods and regional disparities in data reporting.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling outliers to ensure that extreme values did not distort the analysis. Outliers that were deemed errors were corrected or removed.
- **Data Transformation:** The data was transformed to ensure that it was in the right format for analysis, such as converting text fields to categories, standardizing date formats, and aggregating data at the correct levels.
- **Consistency Check:** Ensured that categorical variables (e.g., vehicle type, region) were consistent across the dataset to avoid mismatches during analysis.
